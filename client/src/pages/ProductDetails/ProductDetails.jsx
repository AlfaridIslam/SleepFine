    <h2 class=" font-bold">Rebonded Foam</h2>
    This type of foam is made from recycled foam scraps that are bonded together under high pressure. It is known for its durability and firmness, providing excellent support for the spine.<br><br>
    <h2 class="font-bold">Orthopedic Support</h2>
    These mattresses are often recommended by doctors for individuals with back pain or spinal issues. They help maintain proper spinal alignment and reduce pressure points, which can alleviate pain and discomfort.<br><br>
    <h2 class="font-bold">Firmness</h2>
    Typically, these mattresses have a medium to firm feel, which is ideal for supporting the natural curve of the spine. This firmness helps in distributing body weight evenly and prevents the mattress from sagging.<br><br>
    <h2 class="font-bold">Breathability</h2>
    Orthomed mattresses are designed with breathable materials to ensure good air circulation, keeping the mattress cool and comfortable throughout the night.
